Open Ephys for IMEC Phase III Probes
=======================

This repository contains a 32-bit Windows binary file for the Open Ephys GUI, modified to work with IMEC Neuropix probes. It will run on 64-bit Windows as well.

For the source code, see http://github.com/open-ephys/GUI/tree/neuropix.

This software is still being developed, so we can't guarantee that anything will work as expected. Don't use it for mission-critical data acquisition unless you've thoroughly tested all the features you'll need.

Installation instructions
-------------------------------

1. Use the "Clone in Desktop" button (if you have [Windows GitHub client](http://windows.github.com/) installed) or the "Download ZIP" button on
[this page](https://github.com/open-ephys-GUI-binaries/windows-32/tree/neuropix) to get the files. The advantage of cloning is that you'll be able to easily keep track of any updates by periodically syncing with the neuropix branch. 
Otherwise, you'll have to manually download the software (or build it from source) whenever something changes.

2. Drag the "windows-32-neuropix" (downloaded version) to the location of your choice and rename it "Open Ephys." If you used GitHub for Windows to clone the repository, we recommend leaving it in the "GitHub" folder.

3. Double-click the "open-ephys" application file to run the software.
